## Motivation
The dashboard presents crucial factors in affecting the Preventable Hospital Stay rates and how those variables interact with each other. As well as,
the regions that have the highest rate of preventable hospital stays. The dashboard is designed for epidemiologists to present the data that they have 
collected to the public in a way that is easy to understand. The reason that I built out this dashboard is that it is really important to  convey
information in a concise manner to people who are not subject matter experts. Additionally, hospital care is one of the US biggest healthcare expenditures, 
thus the dashboard is meant to shift the public and policymakers' sentiment towards addressing preventable hospital stays and determining where 
interventions are most needed.

## Dashboard Process
The dataset was really large with a lot of variables dealing with socioeconomics, physical environment, access to care, and health behaviors. Additionally there was information about the confidence intervals, numerator, and denominators of each variable. I removed all of those and kept only the raw values of each of the variables. 
To display the information, I created a choropleth and a histogram that could be interacted with. Originally, I was going to do a histogram based on a linear model that predicts the preventable hospital stay rate, however I had to change tracks and to display a regular histogram. The choropleth demonstrates what region and races have the highest rates of preventable hospital stays (*note* the data is aggregated by each county, and some races do not have enough data to keep anonymity, thus some counties will appear blank on the choropleth). Some things that I have learned along the way is how to create an interactive predictive model and how to better format my layout via CSS and html. At the beginning of my college career, I took an online course on HTML and CSS, so it is interesting to see how I have progressed. 

## Strengths and Weaknesses
Some of the strengths are that I am collaborative, I always have the target audience and real-world applications in my approaches, and I am good at delivering information to diverse audiences so that it is understandable to all. Weaknesses that I need to work on are having a better understanding of using/navigating around GitHub with the command line. Also, I really wanted to model at first but  I think that might have been too ambitious given my time frame, thus in the future I should be more mindful of where my capabilities lie.
