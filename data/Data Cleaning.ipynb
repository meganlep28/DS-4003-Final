    "##Data Description:\n",
    "#Dataset is County Health Rankings & Roadmaps which was compiled by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute in 2023. The dataset has variables \n",
    "#relating to clinical care, health behaviors, physical environment, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes. The data is aggregated by every county in all 50 states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##Why this dataset: \n",
    "#I previously used this dataset for a project over the summer, but I wasn't satisfied with what I turned in so I want to work on it further. Also, I am\n",
    "#currently in an epidemiology class right now, so playing around with surveillance data is cool. Furthermore, my professor mentioned that being able to convey data is \n",
    "#really important to get support (funding, leggislators, etc), so building out a dashboard would be tying this data science class and public health together. \n",
    "#Preventable Hospital Stays is the frequency of hospitalizations due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions, which means hospitalizations that could've been avoided, if care/treatment\n",
    "#was provided earlier. This really speaks on how access, infrastructure, and quality of treatment affect health conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Usage of data:\n",
    "#The data  is collected annually to survey how health is impacted by environmnt, SES, and access to care. The use for this data is to \n",
    "#illuminate what factors are most influential in health outcomes to further improve community public health and creating a \n",
    "#more equitable healthcare system. \n",
    "\n",
    "##How was it collected/provenance:\n",
    "#The dataset was first released annually in 2010 exploring 100 different measures as a way for counties understand how healthy their residents are.\n",
    "#The County Health Rankings Conceptual Model of Health divides the variables into 3 different categories: Health Outcomes, Health Factors, and Policies&Programs.\n",
